## Running individual examples

Individual samples can be run on an Android emulator or device.

Check the `README.md` inside each example folder for instructions.

## Building all examples

Build all examples using ``build_all.sh`` under Linux. First set environment variable `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`, then run the script:

```bash
export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=/path/to/android-sdk
./build_all.sh
```

Run `./build_all.sh --help` to see available options for building specific examples, running tests, and more.

## Configuring API Keys

An API Key is required to unlock the full functionality of these example applications. Follow our [guide](https://developer.magiclane.com/docs/guides/get-started) to generate your API Key. Check the `README.md` inside each example folder for instructions on how to set your API Key.

If no API Key is set, you can still test your apps, but a watermark will be displayed, and all the online services including mapping, searching, routing, etc. will slow down after a few minutes.
